This is because package dependency version ranges may not line up perfectly, causing duplicate installations of the same package. This can happen both for two different plugins using the same service, but also across a plugin and its modules. If your service would break in this scenario, you should not define a default factory for it, but instead require that users of your service explicitly install a factory in their backend instance."))}d.isMDXComponent=!0},862525:e=>{var t=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols,r=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,n=Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable;function o(e){if(null==e)throw new TypeError("Object.assign cannot be called with null or undefined");return Object(e)}e.exports=function(){try{if(!Object.assign)return!1;var e=new String("abc");if(e[5]="de","5"===Object.getOwnPropertyNames(e)[0])return!1;for(var t={},r=0;r<10;r++)t["_"+String.fromCharCode(r)]=r;if("0123456789"!==Object.getOwnPropertyNames(t).map((function(e){return t[e]})).join(""))return!1;var n={};return"abcdefghijklmnopqrst".split("").forEach((function(e){n[e]=e})),"abcdefghijklmnopqrst"===Object.keys(Object.assign({},n)).join("")}catch(o){return!1}}()?Object.assign:function(e,a){for(var i,s,c=o(e),l=1;l<arguments.length;l++){for(var p in i=Object(arguments[l]))r.call(i,p)&&(c[p]=i[p]);if(t){s=t(i);for(var u=0;u<s.length;u++)n.call(i,s[u])&&(c[s[u]]=i[s[u]])}}return c}},541535:(e,t,r)=>{var n=r(862525),o=60103,a=60106;var i=60109,s=60110,c=60112;var l=60115,p=60116;if("function"==typeof Symbol&&Symbol.for){var u=Symbol.for;o=u("react.element"),a=u("react.portal"),u("react.fragment"),u("react.strict_mode"),u("react.profiler"),i=u("react.provider"),s=u("react.context"),c=u("react.forward_ref"),u("react.suspense"),l=u("react.memo"),p=u("react.lazy")}var d="function"==typeof Symbol&&Symbol.iterator;function f(e){for(var t="https://reactjs.org/docs/error-decoder.html?invariant="+e,r=1;r<arguments.length;r++)t+="&args[]="+encodeURIComponent(arguments[r]);return"Minified React error #"+e+"; visit "+t+" for the full message or use the non-minified dev environment for full errors and additional helpful warnings."}var h={isMounted:function(){return!1},enqueueForceUpdate:function(){},enqueueReplaceState:function(){},enqueueSetState:function(){}},v={};function m(e,t,r){this.props=e,this.context=t,this.refs=v,this.updater=r||h}function y(){}function g(e,t,r){this.props=e,this.context=t,this.refs=v,this.updater=r||h}m.prototype.isReactComponent={},m.prototype.setState=function(e,t){if("object"!=typeof e&&"function"!=typeof e&&null!=e)throw Error(f(85));this.updater.enqueueSetState(this,e,t,"setState")},m.prototype.forceUpdate=function(e){this.updater.enqueueForceUpdate(this,e,"forceUpdate")},y.prototype=m.prototype;var b=g.prototype=new y;b.constructor=g,n(b,m.prototype),b.isPureReactComponent=!0;var k={current:null},w=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,S={key:!0,ref:!0,__self:!0,__source:!0};function N(e,t,r){var n,a={},i=null,s=null;if(null!=t)for(n in void 0!==t.ref&&(s=t.ref),void 0!==t.key&&(i=""+t.key),t)w.call(t,n)&&!S.hasOwnProperty(n)&&(a[n]=t[n]);var c=arguments.length-2;if(1===c)a.children=r;else if(1<c){for(var l=Array(c),p=0;p<c;p++)l[p]=arguments[p+2];a.children=l}if(e&&e.defaultProps)for(n in c=e.defaultProps)void 0===a[n]&&(a[n]=c[n]);return{$$typeof:o,type:e,key:i,ref:s,props:a,_owner:k.current}}function x(e){return"object"==typeof e&&null!==e&&e.$$typeof===o}var C=/\/+/g;function O(e,t){return"object"==typeof e&&null!==e&&null!=e.key?function(e){var t={"=":"=0",":":"=2"};return"$"+e.replace(/[=:]/g,(function(e){return t[e]}))}(""+e.key):t.toString(36)}function F(e,t,r,n,i){var s=typeof e;"undefined"!==s&&"boolean"!==s||(e=null);var c=!1;if(null===e)c=!0;else switch(s){case"string":case"number":c=!0;break;case"object":switch(e.$$typeof){case o:case a:c=!0}}if(c)return i=i(c=e),e=""===n?"."+O(c,0):n,Array.isArray(i)?(r="",null!=e&&(r=e.replace(C,"$&/")+"/"),F(i,t,r,"",(function(e){return e}))):null!=i&&(x(i)&&(i=function(e,t){return{$$typeof:o,type:e.type,key:t,ref:e.ref,props:e.props,_owner:e._owner}}(i,r+(!i.key||c&&c.key===i.key?"":(""+i.key).replace(C,"$&/")+"/")+e)),t.push(i)),1;if(c=0,n=""===n?".":n+":",Array.isArray(e))for(var l=0;l<e.length;l++){var p=n+O(s=e[l],l);c+=F(s,t,r,p,i)}else if(p=function(e){return null===e||"object"!=typeof e?null:"function"==typeof(e=d&&e[d]||e["@@iterator"])?e:null}(e),"function"==typeof p)for(e=p.call(e),l=0;!(s=e.next()).done;)c+=F(s=s.value,t,r,p=n+O(s,l++),i);else if("object"===s)throw t=""+e,Error(f(31,"[object Object]"===t?"object with keys {"+Object.keys(e).join(", ")+"}":t));return c}function j(e,t,r){if(null==e)return e;var n=[],o=0;return F(e,n,"","",(function(e){return t.call(r,e,o++)})),n}function T(e){if(-1===e._status){var t=e._result;t=t(),e._status=0,e._result=t,t.then((function(t){0===e._status&&(t=t.default,e._status=1,e._result=t)}),(function(t){0===e._status&&(e._status=2,e._result=t)}))}if(1===e._status)return e._result;throw e._result}var R={current:null};function P(){var e=R.current;if(null===e)throw Error(f(321));return e}},827378:(e,t,r)=>{r(541535)}}]);
